# Dependabot configuration to ignore a security update for webpack-dev-server
# Reason: react-scripts@5 pins webpack-dev-server@^4.x, and no compatible patched version
# is currently available; ignore the specific security advisory for now to avoid failing the
# Dependabot job. Review periodically and remove this ignore when react-scripts or
# webpack-dev-server supplies a compatible patched release.
